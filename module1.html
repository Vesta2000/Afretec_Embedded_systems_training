    <h2>Introduction to Github</h2>
    <h3>What is Github</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub is like a big magic notebook where people who make computer programs can write their code, save it, and share it with others, kind of like how you draw pictures and keep them in a special folder, but this one is on the internet, and other people can help make your picture even better by adding colors or fixing mistakes without ruining your original drawing!
    </p>
    <h3>Why Github?</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub is important because it helps people who make computer programs keep their work safe, organize their code, and work together with others by making changes without losing or breaking anything.

    <h2>Introduction to Git</h2>
    <h3>What is Git</h3>
    <p>
        Git is like a magic save button that remembers every change you make to your work, so if you make a mistake, you can go back to an earlier version instead of starting all over again.
    </p>
    <h3>Why Git</h3>
    <p>
        Git is important because it helps people save their work, keep track of changes, and fix mistakes easily, so they donâ€™t have to start over if something goes wrong, and they can also work with others without mixing things up.

    <h2>Introduction to Web Pushing (Github)</h2>
    <p>Web pushing is a way for websites or web apps to send messages to your device even when you're not actively using them. These notifications pop up on your screen, like when you get a message or an update from an app, to keep you informed about important updates, reminders, or new content. They work through browsers and can be used on desktops and mobile devices.</p>
